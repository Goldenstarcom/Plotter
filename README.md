## Intro :
Robots of the future are a symbol of the combination of art and technology, tools that can accurately and beautifully map and create designs. In this project, inspired by the structure of serial robots like **Makelangelo**, a two-dimensional design robot has been developed using advanced design software such as **Rhino** and **Grasshopper**, as well as custom coding, to provide the ability to create sophisticated designs. The goal of this documentary is to provide a comprehensive and step-by-step guide to the design, construction, and operation of the robot. It not only explains the hardware and software components but also details how the robot interacts with digital designs. With the help of this guide, not only can you understand the operational mechanism of the robot, but also the possibility of redesigning or improving the design for similar projects is provided. This design robot emphasizes precision, personalization, and integration with advanced digital design tools, and can have a wide range of applications in educational, artistic, and industrial fields.


##  Components of the Design Robot  :
   The design robot of this project consists several main components, each one plays a key role in its overall performance. These components include mechanical hardware, electronic components, and software systems. Each of these components and their functions are detailed below :   

### 1 . Mechanical Components  :

* **Frame and Body** :
The robot frame is made of **lightweight** and **durable materials** to ensure balance and stability during movement . also it can easily hold motors and other components in place .

* **Arms and Motion transmission system** :
 The articulated arms move with the help of flexible belts and a pulley system. This part provides the possibility of accurately drawing lines and various shapes .

### 2 . Electronic Components

* **Stepper Motors** :
 Two stepper motors are used to enable precise bi-directional control on the X and Y axes.

* **Microcontroller** :
The main control of the robot is done by a microcontroller such as Arduino. This controller is responsible for receiving commands from the design software and converting them into mechanical movement

* **Drivers** :
For precise and optimal control of stepper motors, drivers are used to generate signals necessary for motor movement. In this project, we used the **TB6600 driver**.

* **Power supply** :
 All electronic components and robot motors receive power from a stable power supply that provides suitable current and voltage

* **External memory** :
In projects with a much larger number of points than the capacity of Arduino, we need to transfer data from the computer to external memory and read the coordinates of the points along with the corresponding code from it

### 3 . Software System   :
* **Programming and Control** :
The robot control software is written in **C++** language and in the **Arduino IDE** environment. This program is responsible for sending precise signals to the drivers for the movement of stepper motors. We also use the **AccelStepper library** for controlling the stepper motors.  

```c++
#include <AccelStepper.h>
#include <MultiStepper.h>
#include "instructions.h"

AccelStepper xAxis(AccelStepper::DRIVER, 7, 8);
AccelStepper yAxis(AccelStepper::DRIVER, 9, 10);
MultiStepper steppers;

void setup() {
  xAxis.setMaxSpeed(1000); // steps per second
  yAxis.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  steppers.addStepper(xAxis);
  steppers.addStepper(yAxis);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    steppers.moveTo(positions[i]);
    steppers.runSpeedToPosition();
  }
}
```


* **Integration with Rhino and Grasshopper** :
The robot software section is designed in a way that it can communicate with advanced design tools such as Rhino and Grasshopper. This capability enables the conversion of digital designs into motion commands .

    G-Code Algorithm for obtaining a list of coordinate points :

* **Coordinate System** :
The robot uses a two-dimensional coordinate system to determine the position of its arms. This system allows for precise positioning of the pen on the paper

## 4. Step-by-Step Testing Guide :
Before deploying the complete system, we follow a structured approach to ensure that each hardware component functions correctly. This helps prevent unnecessary issues and simplifies debugging. At each step, we carefully test the performance of each component to identify and resolve potential problems early. This step-by-step approach ensures that we verify the functionality of each part, making the debugging process and hardware verification much easier.

The robot's software is developed using the Arduino IDE and C++, utilizing the AccelStepper and MultiStepper libraries for precise and synchronized stepper motor control. G-code instructions are parsed and executed in real time, and the robot interfaces with design software (Rhino and Grasshopper) via preprocessed files. Additional modules, such as an SD card reader and a servo motor for marker actuation, are integrated into the firmware. The following tests validate how each of these components work individually and as a complete system.
The process is structured as follows:

#### 4 . 1 . Endstop Testing :
- Verify the proper functioning of the endstop switches
- Use a simple test code to display sensor readings in the Serial Monitor
- Ensure that pressing each endstop switch is correctly detected and stops the system's movement
```c++
/* This code is used to verify the proper functioning of the Endstops.
When the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE is enabled, the output will
normally be "1 - 1".
This is because the Endstops return 1 when they are not pressed.
If either Endstop button is pressed, the corresponding output will
 change to 0.*/

#define LES A0 // Left Endstop switch pin
#define RES A1 // Right Endstop switch pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LES, INPUT);
  pinMode(RES, INPUT);

  // Initialize serial communication with a baud rate of 115200
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the state of both Endstops and print the values to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print(digitalRead(LES));
  Serial.print(" - ");
  Serial.println(digitalRead(RES));
```

#### 4 . 2 . Independent Stepper Motor Testing :
- Test the functionality of each stepper motor
- Rotate the motor 400 steps in one direction and then 400 steps back in the opposite direction
- Ensure that the stepper motor and driver are working correctly by verifying the motorâ€™s movement in both directions
##### 4 . 2 . 1 . Independent Stepper Motor Testing :
```c++
/* This code tests the functionality of the left stepper motor.
   It rotates the motor 400 steps in one direction, then reverses
   the direction and rotates it another 400 steps back.
   This helps verify that the stepper motor and driver are working correctly. */

#define LeftPul 2 // Left Stepper Pulse pin
#define LeftDir 3 // Left Stepper Direction pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LeftPul, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LeftDir, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(LeftDir, HIGH); /* Set direction to HIGH (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on driver) */

  /* Rotate stepper motor 400 steps in the first direction */
  for (int i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LeftPul, HIGH); /* Send a pulse signal */
    digitalWrite(LeftPul, LOW);  /* Turn off the pulse signal */
    delay(2); /* Short delay to control speed */
  }

  digitalWrite(LeftDir, LOW); /* Change direction (reverse) */

  /* Rotate stepper motor 400 steps in the opposite direction */
  for (int i = 0; i < 400; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LeftPul, HIGH); /* Send a pulse signal */
    digitalWrite(LeftPul, LOW);  /* Turn off the pulse signal */
    delay(2); /* Short delay to control speed */
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Empty loop
}
```
